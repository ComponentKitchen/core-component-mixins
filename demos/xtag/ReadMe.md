This example shows how a web component framework such as X-Tag could
*hypothetically* be constructed by deriving from ExtensibleElement and
incorporating a mixture of standard and framework-specific extensions. That's
not to say X-Tag or any framework will actually do this, just that the
extensible architecture here makes that possible.

In this example, the hypothetical X-Tag variant adds an X-Tag specific approach
to wiring up event handlers declaratively.
