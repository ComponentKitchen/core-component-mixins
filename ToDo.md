maintain a Map for super prototype lookups
define a SimpleMap class if Map is unavailable using defineObjectProperty
.extend(args) introduces as few classes as possible?
extensions can inherit -- need to get all properties
@@hasInstance
memoize camelCase/hyphenated name conversions
override setAttribute to avoid recursively setting property
template folding
lazy automatic node finding
